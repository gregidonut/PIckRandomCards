# PickRandomCards

Is a simple commandline app that will output random
cards depending on number input by the user. 

I've created this simple app to play around with generic features
of the C# language.

## How to install

Simply clone the the repo, and compile the binary. It's a pretty simple app

## Possible added patches
- keep track of same cards so users won't have double cards in a single run
